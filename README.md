## Routing

All http requests are redirected to ```index.php``` by ```.htaccess```, then the router takes care of routing the request with the file specified in the router ("./pages").

By default the router only redirects to the index.php of the request url, but you can specify it to redirect to any file within the specified path by adding a false when calling the function.

```php
router('./pages', false)
```
